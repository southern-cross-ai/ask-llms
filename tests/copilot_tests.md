## When is the Easter Day in 2024?
**Easter Day in 2024** falls on **Sunday, March 31st**. It is a significant day in the Christian faith, commemorating the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead according to the New Testament. The Easter Triduum, which begins on the evening of Maundy Thursday, continues through Good Friday, and concludes with prayers on Easter Sunday evening, marks this important event. Easter also signifies the end of Lent (a 40-day period of fasting and prayer) and Holy Week, which starts on Palm Sunday and lasts for 7 days until Holy Saturday[^1^].

For Eastern Orthodox Christians following the Julian calendar, Easter will be celebrated on **Sunday, May 5th, 2024**[^2^]. While Easter's date varies each year, it is determined based on the lunisolar calendar and follows specific rules established by the **Council of Nicaea** in 325 A.D. These rules include celebrating Easter worldwide on a Sunday, following the fourteenth day of the paschal moon, and accounting for the moon whose fourteenth day follows the spring equinox[^1^].

So mark your calendars, and enjoy the Easter festivities! 🐣🌸🙏.
